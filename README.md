# fearandtrembling

It's a song book in progress of about 20 tunes from my first few years in San Francisco. 
Mostly jazz in the style of Thelonious Monk and Sun Ra. Folders have the original
jams that inspired the songs, and (eventually) pdf of the final chart.

## Compositional Style

I start with an interesting harmonic idea and then jam a little on the piano. 
If I like how that sounds, I record it. If I still like it, I try to transcribe it
and then give it structure.

## Use

If you want to use any of this, go for it, but give me credit and don't make money off of it.
If you want to publicly perform/remix/etc., contact me in an issue so we can work out a deal.
